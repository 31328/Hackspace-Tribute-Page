    <h1>Hackspace Tribute Page</h1>
    <p>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step" (Chinese: 千里之行，始於足下; pinyin: Qiānlǐ zhī xíng, shǐyú zú xià;
        literally: "A journey of a thousand li starts beneath one's feet") said Laozi during 6th–5th century BCE. And that
        is exact words that was coming to my mind since and every time I walked through the door of the first
        <a href="https://prestonhackspace.org.uk/about" target="_blank">Preston Hackspace</a> on 28 Good St, Preston PR1 8PE. Wasn't long enough since I decided to learn “How to code?”
        having absolutely no effin & jeffin idea what does that ‘actually’ interprets in the reality of a Front-end Web Developer.
    </p>
    <p>As far as we backtracked with
        <a href="https://prestonhackspace.org.uk/about" target="_blank">Chris</a> (one of the founding members of Hackspace) I joined the Hackspace on Tuesday, October 10, 2017. By that
        time I had been tinkering around with
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.org</a> for about a week or two. Initially following the specific outlined curriculum of FreeCodeCamp
        I was under the impression that I was learning how to become a Front-End Developer, but the as the days were passing
        I began to understand that I had somehow manage to enroll myself for a Chinese language course taught by the Zulu
        tribe somewhere in South Africa… If you still don’t get the feeling I suggest you to watch the movie
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/" target="_blank">Lost in Translation (2003)</a>. The recipe of my learning is quite simple:
        <b>A.</b> fiddle around with FreeCodeCamp until you are in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackadder/epguide/four_major.shtml" target="_blank">the stickiest situation like Sticky the Stick Insect who
            got stuck on a sticky bun</a> and had help - 
        <b>none!</b>,
        <b>B.</b> Google, Stackoverflow it like there is no tomorrow!,
        <b>C.</b> Say “Ok Chris” and Google-Chris (The-man-on-top-of-the-mountain/Computer Samurai) with 28 Dan on his black
        belt will share with you his wisdom and guidance to initiate you and eventyally teach you the Art of Web Development.
        In other words as FreeCodeCamp advises “1.Read the documentation or error, 2.Search Google, 3.Ask your friends for
        help”. Of course things are not that easy because at the same time I need to provide means to an end for myself working
        literally EVERYWHERE at ANY possible labouring and industrial manufacturing work at ANY given time of the day or
        night. Therefore after a class in traditional Chinese - so called 'Front-End Development' - I was off to warehouses,
        industrial factories and “minimum wage jobs”. </p>
    <p> Now 4 months down the ‘Developing Stream’, things starting to take some form and shape in my head and I’m starting to
        form the Magna-Developing-&-Programming-Carta that will help me to know and understand what am I doing as well as
        how to look for it in case that I have idea. Of course I should mention before I forget it “many-many-many” (As Commandant
        Eric Lassard is from the 1984 film Police Academy would say) other anonymous contributors to my learning curve! One
        of them, while advising to participate in Code Jams, mentioned/ warned me: “a serious programmer/developed must know
        thy Sh**t before applying for any junior position”. And that practically interprets to a solid computer science foundation
        by
        <a href="https://www.bbc.com/education/subjects/z34k7ty" target="_blank">BBC Bitesize</a> and knowing the following
        <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/" target="_blank">HTML</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffen-SS" target="_blank">CSS</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" target="_blank">React</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_reduction" target="_blank">Redux</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" target="_blank">ES6</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimple" target="_blank">Git (like zit...)</a> &
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_with_the_Flow" target="_blank">Gitflow</a> branching model,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyro_(food)" target="_blank">Atlassian’s Jira</a> &
        <a href="https://www.kfc.co.uk/our-food/for-sharing/6-piece-bargain-bucket" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a>. Which actually untill this moment I had no idea what they stand for... Do you really want to know
        what I used to see when I read them abbreviations during my first days of coding? Just click the the hyperlinks and
        live the horror with me of how it is not knowing what these things really stand for! </p>
    <p>Anyway, this page is here just to say
        <input type="text" placeholder="write your name and surname..." required id="name" />
        <button type="button" onclick="checkName()">And Submit it!</button> to the all the founding members and supporting fellows of this brilliant idea called 'Preston
        Hackspace' and not to disheart the easy fainted upcoming Web-Developers - regardless of any disadvantage or life
        obstacle. My tribute page is a message and an actual proof that if someone wants to change his/hers circumstances
        by learning how to code from scratch - IT IS POSSIBLE! It will always be a case of wanting or not. </p>
