# Hackspace-Tribute-Page
This is the objective given by the FreeCodeCamp and is called “Build a Tribute Page”. I decided to build a tribute page for 
Preston Hackspace. The following are the step I need to follow and tick the boxes:

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/.
Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.
User Story: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
User Story: I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook. 

Following that I thought to make is trial case page as a ‘school of coding’ itself by trying to implement creative elements that 
will help me to achieve that. For example the ‘thank you’ input box with the button and most of people are already aware.
Just be my guest and propose ANY crazy amendment that will serve and have an educational value for me but let me know before you 
apply it, please!
